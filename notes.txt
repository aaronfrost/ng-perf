- LESS WATCHERS
  - Explain a Watcher
  - Talk about digest cycle
    - $rootScope.$digest
      - digests all children scopes
      - each scope has $$watchers
      - each template binding adds a watcher
      - template bindings
    - Show the digest code
    - Two ways to apply external changes in our code
      - Talk about $scope.$digest
        - This scope down
      - Talk about $scope.$apply
        - rootscope Down

- FASTER WATCHERS
  - Filters affect $digest
    - show filter with zero ms turn around
    - show filter with 1 ms turnaround
    - watch the perf get really bad, real quick

- STOP THE INSANITY
  - ng-mouse(move|enter|up|leave)
  - ng-key(press|down|up)

- LESS SHOW/HIDE
  - Use Link Function
